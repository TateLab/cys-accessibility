# Proteome-wide structure-based accessibility analysis of ligandable and detectable cysteines in chemoproteomic datasets

Code and analysis scripts for integrated analysis of public cysteine profiling datasets with AlphaFold-predicted amino acid accessibility. Accessibility predictions (including IDR prediction) were adapted from Bludau et al (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001636) and are re-distributed in accordance with the Apache 2.0 License.
